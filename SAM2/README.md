# SAM2

After having correctly installed the SAM2 model following this link, you can add the contents of this repository's `videos` folder inside the one SAM2 is providing. Next, you can run the `video_predictor_example_macro.ipynb`. 

The video available is the one used by Axel, the original length of the experimentation is 20 minutes and the microscope take a picture every 9 seconds. With 10 frames per second, it results in an 18 seconds video.
